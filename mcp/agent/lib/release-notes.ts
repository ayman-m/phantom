/**
 * Release-notes history — bundled with the UI image so the About
 * modal works offline (customer environments may be air-gapped from
 * GitHub).
 *
 * Authoring contract:
 *   * Newest entry first. The modal renders in array order.
 *   * `version` is bare semver (no "v" prefix) so it compares
 *     directly with /api/agent/version.
 *   * `date` is ISO yyyy-mm-dd of the GHCR publish.
 *   * `highlights` are 3-7 bullets, operator-facing language. No
 *     internal commit shorthand. Aim for ~10-15 words each.
 *   * `categories` is optional structure for security-heavy releases
 *     where bullets-only flattens too much detail.
 *   * `headline` flags become visual badges in the modal — use
 *     sparingly. `security: true` adds a red shield. `breaking: true`
 *     adds a yellow warning.
 *
 * When you cut a release: prepend a new entry here in the same PR
 * that creates the tag. The image rebuilt for that tag will then
 * carry its own notes — no fetch from GitHub required.
